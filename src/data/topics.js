          { id: "ae1", front: "What is a Rock Pedestal (Mushroom Rock)?", back: "An isolated rock formation with a narrow base and wider top, resembling a mushroom. Wind erosion is most effective near the ground, so the lower part erodes faster, forming a narrow base and wider top." },
          { id: "ae2", front: "What are Demoiselles (Hoodoos)?", back: "Tall, thin columns of rock left standing as softer rock around them erodes away. Often capped by a harder, more resistant rock layer that protects the column from rapid erosion." },
          { id: "ae3", front: "What are Yardangs?", back: "Streamlined, elongated ridges carved into the desert surface by wind erosion. Form parallel to the prevailing wind direction. Strong winds erode softer rock layers, leaving harder layers as aerodynamic ridges." },
          { id: "ae4", front: "What are Zeugen?", back: "Tabular masses or ridges of rock with a flat, hard top surface and softer, eroded base. Formed when wind erodes alternating layers of hard and soft rock — softer layers erode quickly, harder layers remain as tabular features." },
          { id: "ae5", front: "What is an Inselberg?", back: "An isolated hill or mountain rising abruptly from flat desert plains. Remnants of ancient landforms that resisted wind erosion while surrounding softer materials were eroded away. Usually steep-sided." },
          { id: "ae6", front: "What is a Mesa?", back: "A large, flat-topped hill with steep sides (Spanish for 'table'). Wider than it is tall, with a hard erosion-resistant top layer protecting softer underlying rock. Formed by differential erosion." },
          { id: "ae7", front: "What is a Butte?", back: "A smaller, more isolated landform similar to a mesa but with a much smaller top surface area. Essentially a smaller remnant of a mesa, formed as the mesa top continues to erode. Separated by deep gorges or canyons in arid regions." },
          { id: "ae8", front: "How does a Mesa become a Butte?", back: "When the top of a mesa continues to erode, the flat surface area shrinks, eventually leaving a smaller, isolated hill — the butte." },
          { id: "ae9", front: "What is a Dreikanter?", back: "An angular, wind-sculpted rock with three flat faces (German for 'three-edged'). Formed by wind abrasion — sand grains strike the rock surface creating flat, smooth faces. As wind direction shifts, different sides are eroded, producing three or more polished flat faces." },
